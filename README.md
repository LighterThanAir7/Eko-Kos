# EKO-KOS

Eko-Kos is dedicated to transforming outdoor living spaces into sustainable, eco-friendly havens, bridging the gap between nature and our daily lives. The project was requested by a client of mine who specializes in the taking care of gardens and holiday homes.

## Figma
I designed the project from scratch with focus on building **strong** and **clear** visual identity for my client which was thoroughly discussed to make sure his needs are met. 

Feel free to check out my [figma project](https://www.figma.com/file/eSda33TEvBzuGFTdb6BY6A/Eko-Kos?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=WGjCRWrNxIwPMari-1) file.

## Features
- responsive, modern user experience
- dynamic gallery showcasing work
- fancy icons (used as font icons with [icomoon](https://icomoon.io/) tool)
- detailed service descriptions
- interactive contact form

Project was developed using [React](https://react.dev/) and [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) for a sleek, user-friendly experience and integrated with [Email.js](https://www.emailjs.com/) for reliable backend functionalities.
